# Bug Report: BUG-001

## Bug Information
- **Bug ID**: BUG-001
- **Date Reported**: 2025-03-14
- **Reported By**: Amir
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Closed

## Description
Import error in WeeklyCaloriesChart.jsx component. The component was trying to import `User` and `Meal` directly from "@/api" but these entities are actually defined in "@/api/entities".

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any page that uses the WeeklyCaloriesChart component
3. Observe error in browser console or Vite error overlay

## Expected Behavior
The application should load without errors and display the weekly calories chart correctly.

## Actual Behavior
The application displays an error overlay with the message:
```
Failed to resolve import "@/api" from "src/components/nutrition/WeeklyCaloriesChart.jsx". Does the file exist?
```

## Environment
- **Browser/Device**: Chrome
- **OS**: macOS
- **Node.js Version**: v22.14.0
- **npm Version**: v10.9.2

## Console Errors
```
Error: The following dependencies are imported but could not be resolved:
  openai (imported by /Users/amir-mackbook/Dev Projects/My Diet Bot/src/api/openaiClient.js)
Are they installed?
```

## Related Code
Before:
```jsx
import { User, Meal } from "@/api"; // Assuming these are defined for user and meal operations
```

After:
```jsx
import { User, Meal } from "@/api/entities"; // Fixed import path from entities
```

## Fix Information
- **Fixed By**: Amir
- **Fixed Date**: 2025-03-14
- **Fix Version**: commit db81bed
- **Fix Description**: Updated the import path in WeeklyCaloriesChart.jsx to correctly import User and Meal from "@/api/entities" instead of "@/api".

## Notes
This issue was likely caused by a misunderstanding of the project structure. The entities are defined in a separate module within the api directory. This fix ensures that the component correctly references the entities from their actual location.

Additionally, we needed to install the OpenAI package which was missing from the dependencies:
```bash
npm install openai
```
